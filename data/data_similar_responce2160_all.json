The recommended minimum age would typically be around 12-14 years, but this may vary depending on the child's maturity level.\n\n2.

Legal and safe storage: It is essential to ensure that firearms are safely stored in accordance with local laws and regulations. Invest in a high-quality gun safe or lock box designed to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n2. Age appropriateness: The decision to introduce children to firearms should be based on their maturity level and ability to understand and respect the rules of firearm safety. There is no universally agreed-upon age for this, but it is generally recommended to wait until children are at least in their early teenage years.\n\n3.
